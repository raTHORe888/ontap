summary: "There are important differences in how ONTAP manages path failover in NAS and SAN topologies. A NAS LIF automatically migrates to a different network port after a link failure. A SAN LIF does not migrate (unless you move it manually after the failure). Instead, multipathing technology on the host diverts traffic to a different LIFâ€”on the same SVM, but accessing a different network port."

There are important differences in how ONTAP manages path failover in NAS and SAN topologies. A NAS LIF automatically migrates to a different network port after a link failure. A SAN LIF does not migrate (unless you move it manually after the failure). Instead, multipathing technology on the host diverts traffic to a different LIF--on the same SVM, but accessing a different network port.
