_Compression_ reduces the amount of physical storage required for a volume by combining data blocks in _compression groups,_ each of which is stored as a single block. Reads of compressed data are faster than in traditional compression methods because ONTAP decompresses only the compression groups that contain the requested data, not an entire file or LUN.

You can perform inline or postprocess compression, separately or in combination:

* _Inline compression_ compresses data in memory before it is written to disk, significantly reducing the amount of write I/O to a volume, but potentially degrading write performance. Performance-intensive operations are deferred until the next postprocess compression operation, if any.
* _Postprocess compression_ compresses data after it is written to disk, on the same schedule as deduplication.

*_Inline data compaction_* Small files or I/O padded with zeros are stored in a 4 KB block whether or not they require 4 KB of physical storage. _Inline data compaction_ combines data chunks that would ordinarily consume multiple 4 KB blocks into a single 4 KB block on disk. Compaction takes place while data is still in memory, so it is best suited to faster controllers.
