[.lead]
A _cluster administrator_ accesses the admin SVM for the cluster. The admin SVM and a cluster administrator with the reserved name `admin` are automatically created when the cluster is set up.

A cluster administrator with the default `admin` role can administer the entire cluster and its resources. The cluster administrator can create additional cluster administrators with different roles as needed.

An _SVM administrator_ accesses a data SVM. The cluster administrator creates data SVMs and SVM administrators as needed.

SVM administrators are assigned the `vsadmin` role by default. The cluster administrator can assign different roles to SVM administrators as needed.

*_Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)_*

The _role_ assigned to an administrator determines the commands to which the administrator has access. You assign the role when you create the account for the administrator. You can assign a different role or define custom roles as needed.
